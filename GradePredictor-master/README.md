# GradePredictor
Ever regretted choosing a course that messed your GPA up?! Provide your previous grades, URL for courses descriptions page and that is all! The GradePredictor will show you the grade you probably will get in each course you haven't taken yet according to the grades of the taken courses and how similar each course you have taken to other courses.
