# Publications-SearcheEngine
A search engine specified for publications of professors in CS department-Sehir University. The search engine ranks the result according to the word frequency and number of citations of the publication with a variable weight for each ranking method that is to be entered by the user, of course if he wants too! Most importantly, the first time it is used, the SE creates a database of the webpages it crawled and index them in a way that makes it easier and faster to use later.
