# Multivariable-data-analysis-and-Hypothesis-Testing-Using-Linear-and-Multiple-Regression
In this project we are analyzing a set of data about (Gender, Age, Time spent on Facebook and GPA) of sample students and reporting the correlation between variables (two or more). Using a simple GUI, the user can choose freely from the data set variables and by a single click he can analyze the correlation, significance of the apparent effect and create a model that he can use in the same GUI to predict certain values accordingly. The user can get Residuals, R-squared, P-Value, F-value, SSE, Mean, Standard Deviation and many other statistics.
